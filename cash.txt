1. Key difference

Segregation model = how much to put in each domain (safe vs risky) → static rules work.

Recommendation model = which instrument inside that domain → needs live market data (top MFs, ETFs, stock price, gold rate).

2. Data sources you’ll need (India context)

Gold / Silver price → MCX data, RBI published price, or APIs (e.g., Metals-API, NSE/MCX data providers).

Stocks (Blue chip → Small cap) → NSE India / BSE feeds; or APIs like Zerodha Kite, Upstox, Groww, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage.

Mutual Funds (Top SIP / Trending funds) → AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds India) publishes daily NAV + fund data.

ETFs → NSE/BSE listing + AMC websites.

3. Recommendation logic (step by step)
A) Gold / Silver

Show latest price per gram (digital gold, SGB issue price, or physical bullion).

Add note: “Buy SGB when issue is open” vs “Buy ETF/Digital gold anytime”.

Example recommendation:

Gold (SGB 2025 Series II @ ₹6,150/gm) – safe, govt-backed, extra 2.5% interest.

Silver ETF (Nippon India Silver ETF) – trending alternative.

B) Stocks

Classify by risk buckets (safe → risky):

Safe / Blue chip → Nifty 50 names (HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, Reliance, ITC, etc.).

Growth / Mid cap → trending sectors (renewable, pharma, FMCG).

High growth / Small cap → higher volatility but trending (EV suppliers, defence, fintech).

Show top 3–5 based on daily volume + momentum + market cap.

Example output:

Blue chip: HDFC Bank, Infosys, ITC

Fast growth: MapMyIndia, Tanla Platforms, Suzlon Energy

C) Mutual Funds / SIP

Use AMFI NAV ranking + inflow data.

Categorize suggestions:

Large Cap Index Funds (safe baseline): SBI Nifty 50 Index Fund.

Balanced Funds (for medium): HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund.

Small Cap / Growth (for aggressive): Nippon India Small Cap Fund.

Add 1/3/5 yr CAGR return + risk tag.

D) ETFs

Show popular ETFs by AUM + volume:

Nifty 50 ETF (ICICI Prudential, Nippon, HDFC).

Gold ETFs.

Recently trending: Nifty Next 50 ETF, Nasdaq 100 ETF (Motilal Oswal).

4. How to integrate into your model

Step 1: Use user profile → decide category → decide allocation (we already built this).

Step 2: For each domain with allocation >0, fetch latest top-trending instrument (via API).

Step 3: Rank options by safety vs growth inside the domain.

Step 4: Present to user in 2–3 tiers:

“Safe pick” (low risk)

“Balanced pick”

“High growth / trending pick”

5. Example user flow (₹50,000 savings, “young_professional”)

Allocation model →

Savings: ₹2,500

FD: ₹7,500

PPF: ₹10,000

Gold: ₹5,000

Mutual Funds: ₹22,500

Stocks: ₹2,500

Recommendation model →

Gold: Buy SGB Series @ ₹6,150/gm (safe) OR Nippon Gold ETF (liquid).

Mutual Funds: SBI Nifty 50 Index Fund (safe), HDFC Balanced Advantage (medium), Nippon Small Cap (growth).

Stocks: HDFC Bank (safe), Tata Power (growth), MapMyIndia (small cap).

6. Implementation idea

You can:

Start with static curated list (top 5–10 per category) → rotate monthly.

Then later plug in APIs → make recommendations live/trending.
