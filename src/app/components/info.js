export const info = `🔥🕯️ You have stepped inside the cursed ritual chamber of Tatya Vinchu...<br></br>
                  The air is thick with incense and dread.<br></br><br></br>

                  At the center lies an ancient ritual circle, bound by six sacred item types:<br></br>
                  🍎 Fruits, 🍃 Leaves, 🛢️ Oils, 🛠️ Tools, 🐂 Animal Products, and 🔱 Religious Items.<br></br><br></br>

                  ⚔️ Tatya has cast a Query Jaal - a trap woven with SQL logic.<br></br>
                  ✨ Each correct query lights a virtual candle...<br></br>
                  💥 Each mistake triggers a burst of spiritual backlash.<br></br><br></br>

                  😈 One of you is already corrupted, carrying a list of 20 ritual items - only a few of them are pure.<br></br>
                  The other two must solve 5 SQL riddles based on the cursed item table.<br></br><br></br>

                  ⚖️ If at least 3 of your answers match the corrupted list…<br></br>
                  👉 The ritual will allow you to pass.<br></br>
                  ❌ If not… you stay trapped in the Query Jaal forever. 🕸️`;
